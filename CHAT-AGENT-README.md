  --chat-agent-text-color: rgb(var(--color-foreground));
  --chat-agent-background: rgb(var(--color-background));
  --chat-agent-border-radius: 1.2rem;
}
```

### Response Customization

To customize the automated responses, edit the `responses` object in `assets/chat-agent.js`:

```javascript
this.responses = {
  greeting: [
    "Hello! How can I help you today?",
    "Hi there! What can I assist you with?",
    // Add more greeting variations
  ],
  shipping: [
    "We offer free shipping on orders over $50.",
    // Add your shipping policies
  ],
  // Customize other response categories
};
```

### Adding New Response Categories

1. Add a new category to the `responses` object
2. Add matching patterns in the `generateResponse` method
3. Handle the new category in `handleQuickActionResponse`

Example:
```javascript
// In responses object
sizing: [
  "Please check our size guide for accurate measurements.",
  "We offer exchanges for sizing issues within 30 days."
],

// In generateResponse method
if (this.matchesPattern(lowerMessage, ['size', 'sizing', 'fit', 'measurements'])) {
  return this.getRandomResponse('sizing');
